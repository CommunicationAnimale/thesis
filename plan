Things I need to do to finish the thesis.

### Build system

Aim: each chapter of thesis as an ipython notebook.

The notebooks need to compile to latex to allow pdf output.

Latex funcionality is already in ipython. Need to extend to allow figures and
citations and create a suitable template (e.g. extend SEE thesis template).

Possibly use altered pandoc with figure references.

TODO

- working prototype (simple notebook that compiles to see thesis template).
- add in citations
- add in figure references
- directory structure
- build script (e.g. `make chapter1`) - use scons?



### Results

Uggh.




### Methods

Fair progress on this. Have series of technical notes to self on solving some
processing issues. 

First draft: concatenate tech notes.
Second draft: add piv laser / camera details
