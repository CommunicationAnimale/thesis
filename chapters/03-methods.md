=======

The methodology encompassed by this thesis is extensive and covers a
number of topics:

- Visualisation of gravity currents in two layer fluids.
- Pre-processing of large quantities of turbulent piv data.
    - Front relative transform of velocities.
    - Interpolation of missing velocities.
    - Isolation and removal of background wave signal.
    - Rotation correcting the velocity vectors.
