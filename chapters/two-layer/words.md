This will be chapter about experiments in a two layer fluid using
interface visualisation.

What is going to be in here?

Overview of the methods:

- Photos and camera setup (inc position). 

- post processing - how to deal with parallax and stich images
  together.

Overview of the results:

Images of all of the hovmollers for the runs (the 24fps ones at
least).

Some chat about the current literature, inc. a focus on white and
helfrich and typing of the flows.

A focus on the amplitude of the waves that are produced. Can this be
linked to white and helfrich theory? Energy exchange?
